## Install

To run and optionally install xsh (XikiShell), just execute the 'xsh' command, located in the 'bin' dir:

      $ ./bin/xsh

It will walk you through a couple setup steps. If you run into trouble, try running "./bin/xsh -i", which may give better error messages.

You can download Xiki from: https://github.com/trogdoro/xiki/archive/master.tar.gz

### Git

Or, if you have git, you can get Xiki from github via "git clone https://github.com/trogdoro/xiki.git"

### Supported platforms

Supported platforms: MacOS and Linux.  Pair with me if you want to see Windows support, support for your text editor, or just to hack on Xiki! (find me at twitter.com/xiki).
