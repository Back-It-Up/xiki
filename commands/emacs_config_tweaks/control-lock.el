;;;; Commentary
;; Quick Start / installation:
;; 1. Download this file and put it next to other files emacs includes
;; 2. Add this to your .emacs file and restart emacs:
;;      (require 'control-lock)
;;      (control-lock-keys)
;; 3. Type C-, and follow the below steps
;;
;; Use Case:
;;   - Type C-,
;;     - The cursor changes to a an underscore, so you know control-lock is on
;;   - Type n to go to the next line
;;   - Type v to scroll down
;;   - Type xf to open a file
;;   - Type any other chars, and emacs will behave as though control is held down
;;   - Type , to exit control-lock
;;     - The cursor changes back, so you know control-lock is off
;;
;; Input from commands:
;;   When in control lock and a command gets input from the minibuffer, control-lock
;;   doesn't interfere (i.e. chars are temporarily not converted to control chars).
;;
;; Inserting literal char:
;;   Pressing ' will temporarily turn control-lock off for the following key stroke.
;;   This is useful, for example, for typing 's to sort in dired mode.
;;   Holding down shift acts to temporarily disable control-lock
